# Install

Aparture is a Next.js app that runs locally. This page walks through installing Node.js, cloning the repo, and getting a working dev server on macOS, Linux, Windows, or WSL2. On a clean machine, expect 10–15 minutes from start to finish.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js.** Version 20 or 22 both work. The examples below use Node 22.
- **Git** for cloning the repository.
- **~1 GB of disk.** `node_modules` is about 500 MB. Another 300 MB if you install Playwright for the reCAPTCHA fallback (optional, see §3).
- **A shell you're comfortable in.** Bash or zsh on macOS and Linux, PowerShell or WSL2 on Windows. WSL2 is Microsoft's Linux-on-Windows environment; it tends to be faster than native PowerShell for Node-based dev work.

## 1. Install Node

### macOS

Install with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), which lets you switch Node versions per project without sudo.

```bash
# Xcode CLI tools (git, make, clang)
xcode-select --install

# Homebrew (skip if installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.zshrc

# Node 22
nvm install 22
nvm alias default 22
node -v   # should print v22.x.x
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, Arch)

Same nvm approach. Distro packages (`apt install nodejs`) tend to lag behind, so nvm is the simpler path.

```bash
# Build deps (native modules need these)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl build-essential git   # Debian/Ubuntu
# sudo dnf install -y curl gcc-c++ make git                       # Fedora
# sudo pacman -S --needed curl base-devel git                     # Arch

# nvm + Node
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 22
nvm alias default 22
```

### Windows (native PowerShell)

On Windows, [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) is the cleanest Node manager. It installs via winget.

```powershell
# Install fnm
winget install Schniz.fnm

# Add shell integration (paste into $PROFILE, then reopen PowerShell)
# fnm env --use-on-cd | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

fnm install 22
fnm default 22

# Enable Windows long paths (node_modules trees are deep).
# Run as Administrator:
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" `
  -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

::: tip Windows Defender can slow npm install dramatically
If `npm install` takes more than a few minutes, Windows Defender is probably scanning `node_modules` as it's written. Adding exclusions for your dev tree, `%APPDATA%\npm-cache`, and `node.exe` usually drops install time from ~10 minutes to ~1–3.
:::

### WSL2 (Ubuntu on Windows)

If you're on Windows and don't mind a Linux shell, WSL2 is the faster option.

::: tip Keep the repo on the Linux filesystem
Keep the repo at `~/projects/...` inside WSL, not under `/mnt/c/...`. Cross-filesystem I/O is slow, and `npm run dev` can take 60+ seconds to start if the repo lives on a Windows path.
:::

```powershell
# One-time, as Administrator in PowerShell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

Then inside the Ubuntu shell:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y curl build-essential git
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 22
nvm alias default 22

mkdir -p ~/projects
cd ~/projects
```

## 2. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshspeagle/aparture.git
cd aparture
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm install
```

`npm install` pulls roughly 700 packages (~500 MB) and takes 1–3 minutes on a clean machine.

## 3. Set a local access password

Open `.env.local` in any editor and set `ACCESS_PASSWORD` to something you'll remember:

```bash
ACCESS_PASSWORD=pick-anything-memorable
```

Aparture gates the web UI behind this password — the login screen prompts for it, and every API call re-checks it server-side. There's no auto-generation; you pick the value yourself. The example file ships with `ACCESS_PASSWORD=change-me` as a placeholder, which works fine for local-only development, though you should obviously pick something real before exposing the app beyond your own machine.

You'll also add your LLM API key to this same `.env.local` file on the next page. Don't start the dev server yet — it will fail without at least one API key.

## 4. Playwright (optional fallback for reCAPTCHA)

Aparture downloads PDFs directly from arXiv by default, and this works most of the time. Occasionally, arXiv serves a reCAPTCHA challenge instead of the PDF, and the direct download fails. When that happens, Aparture falls back to Playwright — a headless browser that handles the reCAPTCHA session — if it's installed.

Without Playwright, affected papers get a notification in the run log and skip the deep-analysis stage. They still appear in the briefing based on their abstract-level score, with a note that the full PDF wasn't available. Everything else in the pipeline (quick filter, abstract scoring, briefing synthesis, NotebookLM generation) works regardless.

Install it if you'd like the fallback available:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium

# Linux only — installs libnss3, libatk-bridge, etc.
npx playwright install-deps chromium
```

::: tip Don't delete the Playwright profile
The first PDF download that hits reCAPTCHA may prompt you to solve it interactively in a headed browser. Once you solve it, Playwright caches the session in `temp/playwright-profile/` and subsequent runs proceed without prompts. Deleting that folder forces a re-solve on the next affected paper.
:::

## 5. Verify the toolchain

Before moving on, confirm everything installed cleanly:

```bash
node -v                       # v22.x.x
npm -v                        # 10.x or 11.x
npm run lint                  # ESLint passes
npm test                      # Vitest, ~400 tests, ~30s, $0 (fixture-based)
```

If all four pass, the local setup is ready. `npm run dev` still won't work until you've added at least one API key in `.env.local`.

## Common gotchas

**macOS**

- `EACCES` on global install: you likely installed Node via Homebrew instead of nvm. Avoid `sudo npm install -g`; reinstall Node via nvm.

**Linux**

- `Error: Cannot find module` after `nvm install`: your shell init didn't load nvm. Check that `~/.bashrc` contains the nvm block and that you sourced it (or just open a new terminal).
- Playwright complains about `libnss3.so`: run `npx playwright install-deps chromium` (needs sudo).

**Windows native**

- `ENAMETOOLONG` during `npm install`: long paths aren't enabled. Re-run the long-paths step from §1 and set `git config --global core.longpaths true`.

**WSL2**

- `npm run dev` takes 60+ seconds to start: the repo is probably under `/mnt/c/...`. Move it to `~/projects/` on the Linux filesystem.
- `localhost:3000` doesn't load from a Windows browser: WSL2 port-forwarding can take a few seconds on first start. If it persists, run `wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell and reopen.
