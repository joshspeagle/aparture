# NotebookLM Integration

Understanding Aparture's NotebookLM integration and podcast generation.

## What is NotebookLM?

[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com) is Google's AI-powered research assistant that can:

- Synthesize information across multiple documents
- Generate conversational audio overviews (podcasts)
- Create natural dialogue between two AI hosts
- Produce high-quality audio summaries

Aparture integrates with NotebookLM to transform your daily paper analysis into engaging podcasts.

## The Workflow

### Manual Workflow (Web Interface)

1. **Run Aparture analysis** - Generate report
2. **Generate NotebookLM document** - Click "Generate NotebookLM Document"
3. **Download document** - Get `.md` file
4. **Upload to NotebookLM** - Visit notebooklm.google.com, create notebook, upload file
5. **Generate audio** - Click "Generate" in Audio Overview section
6. **Download podcast** - Wait 10-20 minutes, download `.m4a` file

### Automated Workflow (CLI)

```bash
npm run analyze
```

Complete automation:

- Generates analysis report
- Creates NotebookLM document

## NotebookLM Document Structure

The NotebookLM document is specifically structured for audio generation:

### Overview Section

```markdown
# Research Highlights: Computer Science (cs.LG, cs.AI)

Today's analysis examined 47 papers in machine learning and AI.
Several exciting developments emerged across transformer efficiency,
Bayesian methods, and interpretability research.
```

**Purpose:** Set context and frame the discussion

**Characteristics:**

- Conversational tone
- High-level summary
- Engaging opening

### Major Themes

```markdown
## Major Themes

### Transformer Efficiency

Multiple papers tackle the computational challenges of transformers.
Smith et al. introduce "Sparse Hierarchical Attention" which reduces
complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n) while maintaining accuracy...

### Bayesian Deep Learning

There's renewed interest in Bayesian approaches. Jones et al. present
a scalable method for uncertainty estimation in neural networks...
```

**Purpose:** Organize papers into coherent themes

**Characteristics:**

- Thematic grouping
- Clear section headers
- Connected narrative

### Deep Dives

```markdown
## Deep Dive: Sparse Hierarchical Attention

This paper by Smith et al. addresses a fundamental challenge in AI:
transformers are computationally expensive on long sequences.

**The Problem:** Standard attention requires O(n²) operations, making
it impractical for documents beyond a few thousand tokens.

**The Approach:** The authors use hierarchical clustering to create
sparse attention patterns that approximate full attention.

**The Results:** Three times faster training with minimal loss in
accuracy. This opens doors to processing much longer documents.

**Why It Matters:** Could enable new applications in document
understanding, code analysis, and scientific literature review.
```

**Purpose:** Provide detailed analysis of top papers

**Characteristics:**

- Problem-Solution-Impact structure
- Concrete details
- Context and implications
- Audio-friendly narrative

### Connections and Insights

```markdown
## Connecting the Dots

Several papers share common threads:

- Both Smith et al. and Chen et al. use hierarchical structures to
  reduce computational complexity
- Jones et al.'s Bayesian methods could be applied to the attention
  mechanisms in Lee et al.'s work
- The interpretability focus in Brown et al. aligns with growing
  concerns about black-box models

These connections suggest a broader shift toward efficient,
interpretable, and uncertainty-aware AI systems.
```

**Purpose:** Synthesize insights across papers

**Characteristics:**

- Cross-paper connections
- Broader implications
- Forward-looking perspective

## Podcast Customization

### Duration Settings

Configure podcast length in Aparture settings:

- **5 minutes** - Quick highlights
- **10 minutes** - Standard summary
- **15 minutes** - Detailed overview (default)
- **20 minutes** - Comprehensive discussion
- **25 minutes** - Extended analysis
- **30 minutes** - Deep dive

**Recommendation:** 15-20 minutes for daily listening

### Custom Prompts

Aparture uses custom prompts to guide podcast generation. Prompts are defined in `NOTEBOOKLM_PROMPTS.md`:

**5-minute prompt (excerpt):**

```
Focus on the top 3-5 most significant papers only. Keep technical
depth appropriate for audio but maintain accuracy. Each paper should
get 30-60 seconds of discussion maximum...
```

**15-minute prompt (excerpt):**

```
Provide a balanced overview covering:
- 5-7 top papers with moderate technical depth
- Key methodological approaches
- Implications and connections between papers
Target 2-3 minutes per major paper...
```

**30-minute prompt (excerpt):**

```
Create a comprehensive discussion covering:
- Detailed analysis of top papers
- Technical methodology discussion
- Broader context and related work
- Connections across papers
Aim for 3-5 minutes per major paper...
```

### Customizing Prompts

Edit `NOTEBOOKLM_PROMPTS.md` to customize podcast style:

**Example customizations:**

- Add domain-specific context
- Adjust technical depth
- Emphasize certain aspects (methodology, results, implications)
- Change conversation style
- Add humor or personality

::: tip Iterative refinement
Generate a few podcasts with default prompts, then adjust based on what you want more/less of.
